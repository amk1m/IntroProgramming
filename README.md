# Programming in C++ #

Graph BFS: This program takes IMDB data and allows the user to find what movies a given actor is in, find what actors were in a given movie, and show how 2 actors are connected to each other through movies they have been in by performing a BFS. 

Minimax TicTacToe: In this program, the user plays against the computer in a TicTacToe game where the computer avoids losing to the user by implementing the Minimax algorithm. 

Poker Hands: This program generates 5 cards and outputs what type of poker hand it is. This program creates and implements a new vector class.

Towers of Hanoi: This program is a graphic simulation of the Towers of Hanoi problem that uses a recursive solution. The user is asked for input on the starting peg and the number of disks (2-10).

PR1- TicTacToe: This program implements a TicTacToe game. 

PR2- Chromakey: This program takes in an image with a greenscreen background and another image that will be used as the background. The program determines whether each pixel in the greenscreen image should belong to the foreground or the background, and the program replaces the original green background with the new given background image. 

PR3- Maze Solver: This program takes in text input with a specified start and finish, with "." making up the valid positions and the "#" representing a wall in the maze; the number of rows and columns is also given in the input. The program then finds the shortest path from start to finish using BFS and returns the original maze except the path found is replaced with "*".

PR4- OCR: This program takes in a black and white image containing numbers in varying fonts and determines how many and what numbers are presented in the image. The program also creates and implements a BigInt class.
