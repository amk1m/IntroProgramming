// Purpose: Examines the inputted game board to determine a winner
// Input: A game state representing a game board
// Returns: Everything is relative to O, so...

//		0.0 to indicate tie game
//		-1.0 to indicate X wins on this board

// Input: A GameTree node
// Returns: The game score meaning...

//		0.0 to indicate tie game
//		-1.0 to indicate X wins on this board

// Returns: The game score meaning...
//		1.0 to indicate O wins on this board
//		0.0 to indicate tie game
//		-1.0 to indicate X wins on this board

// Purpose: Determines which subtree leads to O winning
// Input: A GameTree node
// Returns: The GTNode* with the winning game state

// Purpose: Decides which square the AI should select
// Input: A game state with the current board's state
// Returns: The square number (1 through 9) the AI selects

// Purpose: Finds which square is different between the 2 boards that are given
// Input: 2 GameStates (passed by reference)
